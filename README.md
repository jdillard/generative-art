A collection of generative art pieces created for the _Wire Garden_ installation.

> Wire Garden is an immersive generative art gallery that blends technology and nature, offering a tranquil space for reflection.
> Visitors step into a serene environment where large digital displays,decorated with plants, pulse with animated art responding to Bellingham’s weather and environmental data.
> Soft natural soundscapes, comfortable seating, and reactive lighting


## _Northern Lights in Mint_ (2025) [[view]](/aurora.html)

Layers of undulating mint-green waves evoke the ethereal dance of the aurora borealis above a snow-covered landscape. Each wave moves with its own distinct rhythm, creating a hypnotic interplay of light and motion that speaks to the harmony found in natural phenomena.

The gentle oscillation of the waves, rendered in real-time, ensures that no two moments are identical – much like the ever-changing patterns of the northern lights themselves. This work explores themes of perpetual motion, natural rhythms, and the delicate balance between chaos and order in natural systems.

## _Digital Alpenglow_ (2025) [[view]](/baker.html)

The piece explores the tension between mathematical precision and natural randomness, using Perlin noise algorithms to generate organic mountainous forms while maintaining the artificial aesthetic of digital wireframes. As the landscape slowly rotates, it reveals new perspectives of its geometric poetry, suggesting both the permanence of mountains and the transient nature of light and perception.

The color palette draws inspiration from the high-altitude phenomenon of alpenglow, translating this natural light effect into a digital space where the boundaries between synthetic and natural beauty blur.

## _Luminescent Flow_ (2025) [[view]](/bioluminescence.html)

Inspired by the bioluminescent phenomena found in ocean environments, this piece explores the emergent patterns of collective motion and natural light. Thousands of particles move through a fluid noise field, their movements dictated by mathematical equations that mirror natural flow patterns. As particles accelerate through certain thresholds, they emit a soft cyan glow – reminiscent of how marine organisms illuminate in response to disturbance or movement.

The subtle wave motions and particle behaviors create an atmosphere of meditative calm while hinting at the complex underlying systems that govern natural phenomena. As you observe, notice how individual particles contribute to larger flowing patterns, much like schools of fish or crowds of fireflies moving in unconscious harmony.

## _Midnight Puddle_ (2025) [[view]](/rain.html)

Digital raindrops create ephemeral ripplese, evoking the surface of a midnight puddle. Each ripple's gentle distortion and gradual fade mirrors the impermanent nature of moments in time, while the subtle distortions in the circular patterns suggest the organic imperfections found in nature.

As generated ripples intersect and overlap, they create fleeting compositions that never repeat, ensuring each viewer's experience is unique and personal.

## _Salmon Run_ (2025) [[view]](/salmon.html)

Schools of salmon navigate an ever-shifting current, their journey reflecting the profound cycles of their natural migration. The piece moves through three distinct phases: the downstream journey of young salmon to the ocean, their mature life in open waters, and their determined return upstream to spawn.

The fluid dynamics are generated through algorithmic flow fields, creating organic patterns that guide the fish through their celestial-like dance. Each salmon responds individually to these invisible currents while maintaining its own unique characteristics, mirroring the delicate balance between individual agency and collective movement found in nature.

## _Infinite Descent_ (2025) [[view]](/ski.html)

A meditation on the rhythmic patterns of winter sports, this piece captures the ephemeral traces left by skiers and snowboarders as they navigate an endless slope. The parallel lines of ski tracks weave their own unique stories - some cautious and measured, others bold and sweeping - while solitary snowboarders occasionally carve their way through the scene with distinctive, fluid movements.

The piece draws inspiration from the temporary marks we leave in nature and the shared experience of winter sports, where no two runs are ever quite the same. As you watch, notice how the randomized behaviors create moments of both harmony and contrast between the various tracks, much like the organic flow of skiers and snowboarders sharing the mountain.

## _Solar Choreography_ (2025) [[view]](/sun-angle.html)

This work explores the dance between Earth and Sun through an abstract visualization of solar paths across twelve months. The piece maps the Sun's changing trajectory at 40° latitude, creating orbital harmonics that mirror our planet's seasonal rhythms.

The result is a meditation on time's cyclical nature and our position in space, rendered through mathematics but softened by elements of chance and continuous motion. The work exists in a perpetual state of becoming, never exactly repeating its pattern, much like the cosmic dance it represents.
